# RPT Boilerplate

This repository is a simple boilerplate to start any project involving the following technologies:

- [React + React DOM](https://reactjs.org/): ^16.12.0

- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/): ^1.12.4

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): ^3.7.3

It comes with the corresponding [@types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) included as `devDependencies`.

## Dev Tools

This project also includes some development dependencies (`devDependencies` in `package.json`) with their respective configuration file for a better developer experience:

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/): `.editorconfig` — not a `devDependency` but allows consistant configuration across IDEs and editors.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [TypeScript parser](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) and React + React Hooks configuration: `.eslintrc` following [this article](https://medium.com/@oliver.grack/using-eslint-with-typescript-and-react-hooks-and-vscode-c583a18f0c75) as a starting point.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): `.prettierrc` — formatting options
